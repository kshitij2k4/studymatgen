Let's begin a series of lab sessions on object oriented programing. Okay. Guess I'll show you a normal lab session or a normal video session over this make code challenge. Or for output the cutting. No, this is not true. I will try to make it very interesting. And you will feel at the end of this session key harmonic Nasca and three cases.\r\n\r\n00:01:06:14 - 00:01:31:15\r\nUnknown\r\nOkay, so we are going to begin this session with a small animation clip where animation there is so much power we can do. Some discuss what concept and then we will switch to code. And on top of it I will try to also visualize the code in front of you on the laptop. And then I will also show how things are working at the back end in the memory.\r\n\r\n00:01:31:16 - 00:01:54:23\r\nUnknown\r\nRight. So I will try to make this session very, very interesting. Please pay attention and let's begin the session now. So today I will start with, as I told you, I'm story. You have a plan where we say that it's an ice cream story or for friends. So let's begin that animation. There are four friends. Very good friends.\r\n\r\n00:01:55:01 - 00:02:23:15\r\nUnknown\r\nWant to decide a hot, sunny summer day. May they start and go for an ice cream party. So don't decide how many flavors go. Taste. Everyone has their favorite kiss. Pistachio. Strawberry. Chocolate. Mango. Then they decided make ice cream parlor or ham ice cream. Now this is a twist arch concept. Understand? Connect with them though scenarios. This animation may be kinky.\r\n\r\n00:02:23:17 - 00:02:54:18\r\nUnknown\r\nIn one scenario I will show you Kubo up me up me. Individual cones cups, mean ice cream car. And in the second scenario I will show you the same. Sharing is caring. They are going to share the ice cream from the same large brick. So they think out. They start and they order their individual flavors and start scooping out from their individual cups of the hurry cars.\r\n\r\n00:02:54:18 - 00:03:19:23\r\nUnknown\r\nSpeed of eating different API. Notice because this we are going to link it with the further session them okay. And some of them are still waiting. So this is one scenario. The second scenario is when they start eating from a brick. Now in this large brick, all of them are eating from the same brick. I Pogacar coincides with gum curry.\r\n\r\n00:03:20:01 - 00:03:43:12\r\nUnknown\r\nWhat will happen? Will ice cream brick sub Carnegie? Will you say different time mini but a time x finish sugar. So this is what I try to show it to you here in this animation they call ice cream car a little bit. Each one of them are eating with a different pace, and the ice cream brick finishes up a big dough.\r\n\r\n00:03:43:12 - 00:04:10:00\r\nUnknown\r\nScenarios decay. Why? Because I don't want to start with a normal boring session key higher variable what I scope. What I do not want to start this lab session with that. This is animation. Say clear the up egg though. Different scenarios but our discussion can devalue egg. Just come link adding individual cup say or do is crumbling carrying a ice cream break say so.\r\n\r\n00:04:10:02 - 00:04:40:08\r\nUnknown\r\nLet's begin the programing session now. The first scenario you have discussed, Carnival is a non-static member. Individual cup say ice cream. Kai we are talking about automatic storage duration. We call them also local variables. So now you duration with that what they have these automatic variables. They try to conserve memory the up memory capacity or in their lifespan.\r\n\r\n00:04:40:10 - 00:05:08:13\r\nUnknown\r\nSomething important is to understand kernel lifespan when they start, when their creation gets started. So when a program starts the control enters in a block and they these variables come alive. They remain alive till the program gets executed in that block. Once the block is exited, okay, out the key, they start getting destroyed. So control C program K blocks.\r\n\r\n00:05:08:13 - 00:05:38:01\r\nUnknown\r\nThey exit to a UNCA life span, maybe finish. Okay, so this is a concept which we try to understand with the and link it with the animation that we have shown how many animation media individually cups ice cream cake. So we'll get individual cups were local variables cookie Vo up may up may pay security will starting back to be different or rather herky up next pizza PC can see.\r\n\r\n00:05:38:03 - 00:06:01:16\r\nUnknown\r\nBut this is what we try to show. So yes, your local variables in place. Basically how they we call them key jalan function declare curry. So you have two parameter list may change your function body game design. So these are two places where they are going to use up animation. Kolya let's quickly see how it works on a code.\r\n\r\n00:06:01:18 - 00:06:28:11\r\nUnknown\r\nSo you try to understand this code. This is a function that you are going to work with. You just show on static which is a function. This make variable pass away. This is a ice cream cone. You individually sub sub k pasta. So this is a variable discussed. We define here. Once you and this is a block this come back.\r\n\r\n00:06:28:12 - 00:06:56:11\r\nUnknown\r\nTheoretically this is a block. This is a block for this scope is block a scope Europace you wrote there or you cut them with some cannot get block is block may job variable declare oga jokey static oga non-static oga local oga us key life is a block duck limited after this block will they do what energy skip visibility cut the mosaic and this is the driver.\r\n\r\n00:06:56:16 - 00:07:19:21\r\nUnknown\r\nYou all know these are code program like pair those. Skip each driver with a going function call run con karega this to LRU which we go. There is a driver which controls the function. So in this case this function is controlled by mean. So the operating system with that it starts calling this main first subsidiary main call okay.\r\n\r\n00:07:19:23 - 00:07:55:09\r\nUnknown\r\nAnd then you start execution of the code whatever is the part of mean. Now if you look at the main category what you see tell me. Yes it is a for loop. And you see there is one local variable which has a value initialized with zero. And it has to run up to five times. And on every run it is going to increment the value and call this function with that incremented or whatever is you call it as the latest value.\r\n\r\n00:07:55:11 - 00:08:29:04\r\nUnknown\r\nSo every time the program runs, it will call the variable. I with its new value some animation. They also apply the hierarchy basic top to. So if you try to work out this solution and see some visualize kernels array so you have a cap. This cap corresponds to this variable. So on every call what you see is a variable in CR is initialized.\r\n\r\n00:08:29:06 - 00:08:56:07\r\nUnknown\r\nAnd when it is initialized it gets a new value every time. So if you go back to the code, you see every time this variable starting from zero, it is getting initialized. And whatever the value is incremented, that incremented value is going to go in this function. So let us say the first run when the first time the function goes here, it gets copy.\r\n\r\n00:08:56:07 - 00:09:27:01\r\nUnknown\r\nTo this argument I'm given a function. May arguments pass okay. So function may arguments to accept kernel variable okay. So do I variable up here. Let's go accept kernel variable to cut. Now this variable is used for calculations of a local variable okay. It's got life to be sure. Over a block. Enter over. And in this case how many people read local variable.\r\n\r\n00:09:27:03 - 00:10:00:08\r\nUnknown\r\nHow many happy non-static declare here to be life. To be sure Oga, whenever the block enters the code. So when when it enters the code, it takes the initial value and whatever is the current value function calls. I was like a calculation correct? And then it is simply going to output the code which is a normal output, and and so once it ends your call, one single call finishes up.\r\n\r\n00:10:00:10 - 00:10:27:17\r\nUnknown\r\nSo Abby's animation you just pass in a couple how some ice cream, the ice cream character and then suddenly his cup gets his ice cream gets finished. So a call to now the other person, if you look at this, is a second subsequent call. Second subsequent call Kabuga jump IQ value increment of the egg. So if we go back and see initially I key value zero three.\r\n\r\n00:10:27:19 - 00:10:56:14\r\nUnknown\r\nAnd then once the increment is done I value becomes one up. Yes. Dosa individual person got up okay. So then this goes to the function call for say a local variable. Create over for local variable major value I key. This time it will be one but your local variable face. Initialize all and then it is going to get the value which is a result of zero plus one.\r\n\r\n00:10:56:16 - 00:11:32:01\r\nUnknown\r\nAnd this is going to give you the output as one. So every increment works on independent local variable. The one that you have seen in animation. Every person is scooping out ice cream for their from their own cup. Abdul Abubakar range. It's be speed say cloudy did not cloudy Kitna time later. Yes sub ignorant say imagine you block to is block in the job equal to also variable case that who hooray is corresponding to that person who is eating that ice cream.\r\n\r\n00:11:32:03 - 00:12:03:17\r\nUnknown\r\nI think up relate car part online sub physical gas able person ice cream character and then how we can initialize individual cones double layer cups layer. So this corresponds to the the lifespan of a local variable. So they say local variables work out. Let's quickly go back. And every time when you are going to see the output in the first call, it is one zero because it starts with the zero value.\r\n\r\n00:12:03:19 - 00:12:33:17\r\nUnknown\r\nNow once the first call is made, it becomes zero plus one. The output becomes one. Up here local to this was local. This was also local. Basically lifespan her bar change her egg time. Pay us key values update or do values update orient very function calls which was only the second time? Is key value increment okay to get to a key value already up, never say zero.\r\n\r\n00:12:33:17 - 00:13:00:12\r\nUnknown\r\nInitialize quality because you abide by the initialize okay, so again the output becomes two. Third case me. This local variables becomes three, then in fourth case it becomes four. So like this. Whenever you start on adding these values you get these output up impact q okay non-local three non-static three. They are local variables. They are automatic variables have different names.\r\n\r\n00:13:00:12 - 00:13:37:00\r\nUnknown\r\nAnd go identify output is estancia. Every time my variable Germany local declare key declare the. Let us go back and see you happy. So this has an important role to play is variable in a variable local to this bolsa bolsa a variable non-static to the non-static variable every time a p lifecycle may zero say start here. And because zero start here, the job values are empty, they keep on getting added or output result.\r\n\r\n00:13:37:00 - 00:14:04:11\r\nUnknown\r\nMay a sequence of numbers are zero, one, two, three and four. So yeah yeah first scenario. So one scenario is done when a person each of the four friends are eating their own cup, which means they are eating from their own local variable cups. And the rate at which they eat is also different. Why this? That's different. Can you think about it?\r\n\r\n00:14:04:13 - 00:14:34:23\r\nUnknown\r\nAny guesses? Yes, it's different because every time the value of that variable is getting re initialized. So Harvard Business School name scope may enter character. It was an individual cup up to the CBA ice cream cake go whenever they start consuming they. That is not impacting the cup of other friends. So this is what we have seen in the first part of the video.\r\n\r\n00:14:35:01 - 00:15:07:05\r\nUnknown\r\nNow let's move out and go to the second part of the scenario, which was a static member. Now static member memory. What we are going to look at is animation. Me I'm next second scenario data right. Second scenario. What we saw a large break t or individual sorry flavor. Say or all the four friends were trying to scoop out from their individual from that same single break, large break.\r\n\r\n00:15:07:07 - 00:15:35:22\r\nUnknown\r\nSo yes, scenario could some relate concept behind static variables say a code may say how identify goes a thing because I'm nick property key Q local variable local or they're here happy differentiate whenever you declare any static variable one key life Java program should. Which means a key bar. Leave me out there so they will not get initialized every time I see.\r\n\r\n00:15:35:23 - 00:16:08:08\r\nUnknown\r\nOkay, now, because program a key bar begins, so when the program terminates, their life will get exited. Their life will get. They will get dead only when the program terminate your key, possibly life. That game remains alive only during the entire program execution, and not on the basis of a block local key case they have. Block is getting, impacting the the lifespan then storage a measure a key bar initialize.\r\n\r\n00:16:08:10 - 00:16:32:03\r\nUnknown\r\nThis is what we have to make it understand here from the code. And these variable are going to retain the values. Retain means orange Joe last call p value query. Whatever function did to that value will value dissolve new value retain. Right. This is what we say. Give a value. Retain say calculation impact. Tiger. This is what we have to see in the code.\r\n\r\n00:16:32:05 - 00:17:01:20\r\nUnknown\r\nSo this program tells you key static very same code. Say understand because it is static variable pick as if you try to relate its program code me or next program code me a key difference which is how I used here static. So Java lab me program to try to understand key job local variable declare kanina to give keyword use machine gun which means the.\r\n\r\n00:17:01:22 - 00:17:24:23\r\nUnknown\r\nThat is going to be an automatic variable. That is going to be a local variable. You can also write auto keyword, local key case, may auto keyword public sector. But even if you do not write it, it is assumed key compiler work. You have to wake local variable with individual ice cream car cup static variable. May you have same key up.\r\n\r\n00:17:24:23 - 00:17:51:20\r\nUnknown\r\nHow many big a keyword used here, which is called static is static keyword. You is going to stick individual up cups ice extremely car humming brick ice cream car which means up a variable. You see a key property matching here. It is not now shedding and carrying. It is a concept where it is like a public figure. The ice cream that you are trying to eat is consumed by all four friends together.\r\n\r\n00:17:51:22 - 00:18:16:00\r\nUnknown\r\nSo you have a static keyword. You cannot say yay impact to a key. It is going to be initialized only once. This is important in your Java code. Okay, so static keyword can impact up. Then when you try to code it is key. Life may a initialization set of egg. So zero comes in the life of this variable only once a current variable.\r\n\r\n00:18:16:00 - 00:18:47:05\r\nUnknown\r\nWell here Germany last semi the key. Whenever you run a code, the loop is same. It starts with a zero value. It goes up to five and then every time it is incremented and that value is passed in a function call. So GOP value pass. Good okay. What value is happy copy of the egg? But in fact if keyword say because some next static keyword you square to a variable state of life may akhbar initialize oga.\r\n\r\n00:18:47:07 - 00:19:11:17\r\nUnknown\r\nIf I just quickly go back and little bit reverse and show it to you, can you have any non static keyword you see at many going static keyword use ninja. So they go zero Hampshire reset. All right. Like resetting the variable with the zero value every time your code comes in this block. So get difference up. Understand cursor to Java up static use carrier.\r\n\r\n00:19:11:19 - 00:19:43:03\r\nUnknown\r\nThose static case may key every time whenever the code enters this block. What is the block j block. So whenever the code enters this block j zero AK. Initialize over in the lifespan. So every time let's work out key first time Java I key value zero key those static key value b variable key b value zero t. Now next time when I becomes one the static variable gets added zero plus one.\r\n\r\n00:19:43:05 - 00:20:20:12\r\nUnknown\r\nThis is going to give you the value of one, say Reinitialize neoga. It will start with a value of one. So I key value 2K0 control. So it is not going to add two zero last name only. They of give two pad key to two result. But this is not going to happen now Q because of a static variable say d carrier to a Reinitialize Neoga your last value, we will see like it is a like a, and it is going to add two to it, which is going to give you a result of three.\r\n\r\n00:20:20:14 - 00:21:06:17\r\nUnknown\r\nSo if you look at the output so output vector gets visualize getting a one by me. They can let us see the output cookie lifespan of variable. How many change cardia. What we did. Let us see that I key value zero t. Awesome a first time static variable b zero. So initialize. But next time when the value of this variable is incremented to one static key value, which value retain we which was zero plus one in subsequent call I key value two three is time by key value two pass with function control me so static in that case becomes two plus one.\r\n\r\n00:21:06:21 - 00:21:39:03\r\nUnknown\r\nSo two plus one which gives you three. When I value changes two three static variable will retain its previous value. And this is going to give you the result six. So see the impact JVM local variables say worker at the individual scope may say I scream correct. So hierarchy speed up the hierarchy lifespan up to the moment we moved to break sub friends in bricks should open their up speeds.\r\n\r\n00:21:39:04 - 00:22:04:22\r\nUnknown\r\nOther high speed. Come here US compact Java Serpico same time main break finish. As you can see quickly. Still your break gets finished soon because of sub share for you as a static variables may update different calls function calls key but her time function call me static variable share okay so job previous value. The variable key was written over here.\r\n\r\n00:22:05:00 - 00:22:34:20\r\nUnknown\r\nThis is what we have to link out. And now. Concept para animation maker A background check Cisco program cutting a that we have to see it here. So students let us time. Let's visualize this with the help of a visualization. So I show you a visualization here.\r\n\r\n00:22:34:21 - 00:23:02:14\r\nUnknown\r\nEchoing an example A job one minute session me example data visualization cutting. So code layer and app case me optional app file create curfew. So you go to file, open the source file. And in the source file you are going to type the new code. Just to save time. Many already see code type character. And when you type the code you have to save this file with the extension CP.\r\n\r\n00:23:02:16 - 00:23:34:09\r\nUnknown\r\nSo your your file has to be saved first and save as we click say basic window open okay. This window you give a name to your test file and CP extension is automatically selected. And you click on save. So you see up to CP File save. Now I will show you the file which I have already created is file co-create curly change programing lab ID worker subset subset source file create curtain.\r\n\r\n00:23:34:11 - 00:24:05:04\r\nUnknown\r\nAnd then we start compilation QC, compile tummy errors. So in go to the execute section and compile click on compile. There is a shortcut key F9. Also in dev C plus plus up the Nietzsche up go up K screen per the Kaga that you are getting zero errors zero warnings. And then I have to see what is the output of the first case individually higher variable local variable key than our data.\r\n\r\n00:24:05:10 - 00:24:27:09\r\nUnknown\r\nSo it was getting initialized every time from zero. So output Arata will guess. I just click on execute k click on run and this is going to show you the output. This output is going to show you the same output that I have shown you in this session zero, one two, three and four. So this was the static part.\r\n\r\n00:24:27:11 - 00:24:53:22\r\nUnknown\r\nNow let us see the non-static part. Let us see the static part. Now when we show the static part process same rigor a file create here okay Koji save cpp file go. And then you start execution. When you start execution subset you have to compile the code. Once you click on compile errors, meaning you will get zero errors and zero warnings.\r\n\r\n00:24:54:00 - 00:25:22:18\r\nUnknown\r\nAnd then you click on run. Once you run it, you get the output, the same output. You both pay this session me you get the first output as zero, then one, then three, then six, and then ten. Because static variables a shared property here is key. Lifespan program retire. It remains, it remains active and when the program is executed the static variable goes down.\r\n\r\n00:25:22:20 - 00:25:53:07\r\nUnknown\r\nSo you take visualization. You get your opinion. Normally a developer ID may create here up output to some code be like there. But where is the problem? The problem is so much meaning Iraqi background may memory make essay work or cup variable create a variable initialize. We come reinitialize. We use a a bit out of the box. I make quickly a new there, so what I will recommend is I will show you the code visualization.\r\n\r\n00:25:53:07 - 00:26:17:18\r\nUnknown\r\nAlso. So pick site page which is called Python tutor.com on this side whenever it supports multiple languages, just have coding be a python support, cut a Java script c c plus plus Java support cut there. Now today our session is on Object Oriented programing in C plus plus. So many write in code page C plus plus code select in a.\r\n\r\n00:26:17:19 - 00:26:46:03\r\nUnknown\r\nOnce I click on select, this is going to show me a workspace of many times kernel already Cody happy like away already. You can just copy it and paste it. The same code need static or non static scope. And you see a button here below which is called visualize execution. So when you click on Visualize execution a quick message the higher that you receive your visualization is going to start soon up.\r\n\r\n00:26:46:08 - 00:27:12:13\r\nUnknown\r\nWhen you start visualizing a workspace, you which is going to show you the output which is called print output. You will see whatever is output ID, you will see the output on this part of the screen. And up came memory me up k Jo-Jo variables jobs jump create a will be shown here in the stack, and the heap part automatically supports heap Sierra memory allocation B sub heap Sierra.\r\n\r\n00:27:12:15 - 00:27:37:16\r\nUnknown\r\nWhat is the call trace? What is the function trace will stack maintain correct top deco. You automatically pointer in a red line or a light color line. The code which shows key next line to be executed is always highlighted in red color. So your machine has started execution. You have to click on next. You see these steps here one 243.\r\n\r\n00:27:37:18 - 00:28:03:04\r\nUnknown\r\nSo when you start clicking on next, it is going to execute the first code in the block which is a for loop, a for loop. Me I initialize the visualization. I initialize var but have equal value. I is linear happy int data type Nazareth. But the value is question mark a line a b execute anywhere once the line get executed.\r\n\r\n00:28:03:09 - 00:28:27:13\r\nUnknown\r\nSo API key value Klg zero. Pay set to digi because you are initializing it with zero. Then I have to click on next to get this line executed. Update impact. Dako JBL line zero pay out. Execute okay the first time I key value zero initialize okay which you can see it here and function call up Johnny Vala because it is line to be executed.\r\n\r\n00:28:27:18 - 00:28:53:16\r\nUnknown\r\nShow on stat is going to call a function which is non-static scope and it is going to pass this. I value zero in this function. Let's see what happens if I click on next Germany next click here to up up call stack me the operator is so much memory. Look at this your stack part. Upgrade the car. Now be a function call key you trace.\r\n\r\n00:28:53:18 - 00:29:20:10\r\nUnknown\r\nYes stack. Maintain the. The first thing that you would go to show is show on start a function call execute to a maybe local variable. Key value is like question mark the correct Java first line of execution. Carlos. Accordingly, you stack me values. Update of these. So let's do that quickly. Next click here. Non-static zero. Initialize okay.\r\n\r\n00:29:20:12 - 00:29:44:23\r\nUnknown\r\nCurrent zero is an initialize of Jager JCM is go execute current level a value call initialize key which is current. Let's go and see what is the impact. First line execute okay to do no values zero okay. And then second line which is going to be executed is adding the value of the non static variable and the current variable.\r\n\r\n00:29:45:01 - 00:30:11:03\r\nUnknown\r\nWhen you add up the value it becomes zero. And this is how your next line which is about C lb will get executed. The same code go execute currency. So they go up budget okay dashboard pay up go already in other output queue. So the non static output the first output is zero. So g assembly the assume. Get your money initially zeros in strategy to zero.\r\n\r\n00:30:11:05 - 00:30:45:14\r\nUnknown\r\nI have to again say I'll be happy a block execution and up program X00 yes. No because it is a loop to observe say program, but reinitialize the value of I increment Jesse I key value in payment. Oga you see the impact line execute. We are execute the I key value of zero because initialization loop may variable x a key value one.\r\n\r\n00:30:45:16 - 00:31:23:17\r\nUnknown\r\nAnd then you start making a call to again the function. It enters the block. It again sets the value to one or for queue okay. Non-static is a zero value or for initialize k add up. Khadija. And it is going to show you the output of one. Let's execute that line and the next line may output. So if you start execution of the code zero say one output up to sequentially, tell Jessie up is slider move cur okay I grab go fast execution like now back up 31 line pay as you go.\r\n\r\n00:31:23:21 - 00:32:01:02\r\nUnknown\r\nYou keep on moving this line up to your last call. Level 42 pair 42. Pay call value. Sorry zero, one, two, three and four initialize. Okay. Sorry. Calls khatam okay or up to initialization finish. Okay, so when you end execution I say stack empty oga aka heap as it is show sorry outputs are poor visualize kernel so memory may you understand kernel because the cup variable lifespan zero that whenever it ends at what time it ends values like it will start good there.\r\n\r\n00:32:01:04 - 00:32:29:23\r\nUnknown\r\nSo this Python tutor website is a very useful website of Java code kernel. Obviously visualize a quick cup execution k time may variables life. May I think up execute on the uncut variable scope quality. So this is all about visualization visualization maker how useful visualization is. How many visualize k dev C plus plus P ranker give you a clear kickass code.\r\n\r\n00:32:29:23 - 00:32:58:03\r\nUnknown\r\nRun with a memory. Make visualization all day up. It's time to check your understanding. Key session key Nabi discussion. Who are to witness how much media. So for that, let's move on to a quick output based question. I will show you some code and Smith static or non static variable. You have some discussion k one don't use it.\r\n\r\n00:32:58:05 - 00:33:21:18\r\nUnknown\r\nAnd best part k don't know. Variables can name be same. So you have to comprehend k is program linking to what will be the output of the code. So in normal declarations in German misha file inclusions k. Now this is the point to note you make variable code, declare which is non static. I told you in the beginning.\r\n\r\n00:33:21:18 - 00:33:55:14\r\nUnknown\r\nAlso key job Bkb variable co local scope may declare kernel. Don't use the keyword static. So here's x becomes a non static variable. This key value initial values domain set k is 0.5. Freedom nick function co declare key by the name fun or void. You need to indicate k which is void. Let me highlight this. This function fun with an argument void means key is key.\r\n\r\n00:33:55:14 - 00:34:27:03\r\nUnknown\r\nPass cube argument name empty. Here arguments me parameters pass name. Then we write the main driver, the main driver of the code. What will be the main driver? The main function. What this main function has the declare subgoal. It's a while loop, right? So while loop runs with the value of x point five up to less than point 10.0.\r\n\r\n00:34:27:05 - 00:34:57:09\r\nUnknown\r\nSo a while loop execute oga, what will happen in that loop? Let us look at that scope of dodgem curly braces. Then we are defining a new scope every time. So you have x value. Here x plus is equal to one which means job function, fund return karega will stay value x me and it will get stored back to x key.\r\n\r\n00:34:57:10 - 00:35:32:05\r\nUnknown\r\nHappy ache operator plus is equal to use away which means assignment and addition. Don't know such set operate carry. Then to differentiate you give him any variable name same like so to differentiate key case key value main function. Say I guess key value. Fun function. Say here we have given a message. We then mean so message like output case at that the value which is printed is from the main function.\r\n\r\n00:35:32:07 - 00:36:12:06\r\nUnknown\r\nThen a normal weight setter is applied and the value is printed. Yaha function close okay. Main function v close okay, because it is returning a value zero. Now the important point of function fun declare key is key definition gap comprehension. See? But I don't know its session me how many key, static or non static variables to how many output based or sleep apnea key static or non static or will be other variable name same how they are going to behave in your code.\r\n\r\n00:36:12:09 - 00:36:44:16\r\nUnknown\r\nYou understand can so to differentiate. As I told you earlier I'm Nihar within fun cardio which means how my output may output variable function function Europe it us a difference a hum simply x key value print array buzzard ache increment operator be use carry what it is going to do. Bolo right. It is going to increment the value of a variable x by one.\r\n\r\n00:36:44:18 - 00:37:15:11\r\nUnknown\r\nDefault is one. So and it is going to print the value. After printing it is going to return this x value to Apple is called Co comprehend key button and key key. Understanding static or non static variable. Key case though no codes don't know segments x I main function x I fun x I non-static variable x x I static variable x up to say variable differentiate karega gas storage hoga.\r\n\r\n00:37:15:13 - 00:37:42:06\r\nUnknown\r\nBased on today's understanding, you have to tell me the output quickly. Workout karo, do it on your notepad or do it on your laptops and tell me what will be the solution. For Ram discussion Kirti. Right, so let's move on and say a solution workout. There are two things to understand. Let's work out on that X side up.\r\n\r\n00:37:42:06 - 00:38:14:10\r\nUnknown\r\nGive us main function or X side app. Give us funny. In main function you have a non static x. And here you have a static x ABC key understanding. Say a clarity of scope can say work got static or non static workout. Carneiro will try to figure out. So let's move out. Move and go back to the code.\r\n\r\n00:38:14:12 - 00:38:41:03\r\nUnknown\r\nCode make it visible. Hannah John. Highlight key important points. So just try to understand what is going to start with what is going to be working with the value of x. Initially you has zero. Say start to a initial value 0.5 t. You have initial value zero t right. So what will do this is going to increment the value.\r\n\r\n00:38:41:05 - 00:39:10:17\r\nUnknown\r\nIt is going to return the value. And before incrementing it is going to print. So after your fun function will three task for printing incrementing by one and returning the value main function. Make your x key job value here initial value, current value or semi job function key and return value will add up. Daddy. So this is what is the operation happening.\r\n\r\n00:39:10:18 - 00:39:41:13\r\nUnknown\r\nSo x key value zero t you static variable to x key value increment okay. Print e which means zero increment okay which means one and return okay which means one. What will happen here x key value 0.5 here or 1.5 you happy one key start add updating. And this is going to give you 1.5. So either comprehend or not here key.\r\n\r\n00:39:41:13 - 00:40:19:07\r\nUnknown\r\nFirst call k bad k output either. So from main you will get 1.5. And from the function fun the value is zero. So when when. This is the first call effect here, let's go back to the previous case of opposite function call up ask session me. It is understand query sub Nikki job static variable order what me value go last value go retain Gerta naki var per say initialize.\r\n\r\n00:40:19:07 - 00:41:06:19\r\nUnknown\r\nGot to. And this is the beauty of static variables. So Java function call var per second time because value will be true x key value. Last next case spaghetti. What is the current value of x 1.5. And if you go back to the code and see 1.5 is less than 10.02 condition true. If I say loop, it will go back to function call function call Cuchillo static variable p operate correct or skip previous value job will retain karega job increment with the previous value three one so one q sat level one print karega which means the output one Naga increment okay two I got or return b two.\r\n\r\n00:41:06:19 - 00:41:34:23\r\nUnknown\r\nOga. These are the three things that are happening function Funmi print order. Hey increment order here or return. Okay so all these three things are happening in function. Fun. When you move back to main main move upper say job previous value x key will see me add up oga previous value of x key calculate. It was 1.51.5 k start Ju return.\r\n\r\n00:41:34:23 - 00:42:16:08\r\nUnknown\r\nWe will value y two, so after the total value I will 3.5. So impact the point calculation here you understand gave the how a static variable behaves with always a non-static variable x. This difference you have to understand and highlight. So first call me to effect. Second call me. It becomes one and 3.5. So subsequently Javan Baba save up a score pay move to next time pay its key value one say increment okay the last incremented value p for 232.\r\n\r\n00:42:16:08 - 00:42:50:13\r\nUnknown\r\nSo increment okay three. Gigi. Right and three return okay. You last value calculate okay. It was 3.33. So 3.53.5 will be added with three and you will get 6.5. So subsequent values may give us job Vicky values I think what you will get is in this call. When it is two the value will be 6.5. So this is how you are progressing with the code.\r\n\r\n00:42:50:15 - 00:43:25:04\r\nUnknown\r\nSo comprehend clinically important point is when you make a call, when the fund value. When the function within fund is zero, the main gives you 1.5. When it is one, the main gives you 3.5. When it is two, the main gives you 6.5, and when it is three, main gives you 10.5. So it is just because the API variable to will guess that the static are very static.\r\n\r\n00:43:25:04 - 00:44:04:02\r\nUnknown\r\nNahi hota local hota. So what would have been the case? H Papa's Jackie lab practitioner a c code may say static variable, static keyword Cortana sorry and then start execution of that code again or the output may get change. This is going to help you out to understand key static versus non-static variables. Gases behave. So a output cable I hope you have understood you come Nathan visualizations curly developer ID how many execution we clear.\r\n\r\n00:44:04:03 - 00:44:33:22\r\nUnknown\r\nAnd we have also seen how the output of the code behaves. So with this I hope t thumbs up go static or non static scope declarations are clearly so much making it through a program x. Simple question please tell us maybe way before we summarize the sessions and conclude, read the question first carefully. What happens to a value of a static variable after a program exists?\r\n\r\n00:44:33:22 - 00:45:04:20\r\nUnknown\r\nS scope s question may be a point was important. Exist s scope or hired a data scope is defined every time with a curly brace. So whenever a scope program enters in a scope, it starts execution. Whenever it ends, it comes out from the scope, it ends the execution. Now the question is on, not on local variable, but a static variable.\r\n\r\n00:45:04:21 - 00:45:34:08\r\nUnknown\r\nSo program is of static variable update scope, say barriga. What will happen? Value is lost, cannot be accessed again. Option to value is retained and can be accessed in the next program run. When we say next program run is Matlab next function call run. It is not leap programs exit. We are talking about this scope exit. So whenever it comes back to that scope it will skip.\r\n\r\n00:45:34:10 - 00:46:12:02\r\nUnknown\r\nThird option value becomes zero. Fourth option last option value becomes undefined. Answer me which one is correct? Option. Static non-static scope. So you can define variable consumption. Correct op static variable. Declare curl scope. Barrio Abby program. The x value is zero. So what is was it lost? Was it accessed again? Was it zero? What did happen? Yes.\r\n\r\n00:46:12:04 - 00:46:44:23\r\nUnknown\r\nIt wasn't lost. It wasn't accessed become zero. It was retained. So for on basis of that we can say option B is the correct option because X key value retain O.G. which means up next subsequent function call Jabil scope. It will retain the previous value. So with this we are going to conclude this session Casa Larga session. How many animations start Kiya visualization band here.\r\n\r\n00:46:45:01 - 00:47:17:08\r\nUnknown\r\nSo you get to know key visualize path lab sessions of courage to memory background make some machining. But then because co id output. So there is there but some Jordanian key how the output is getting executed. Memory make up variable layer variable z who is pathogenesis party. So for that visualization is important. And I told you that a session interesting my Naga session normal lab session because hum happy visualization.\r\n\r\n00:47:17:08 - 00:47:45:12\r\nUnknown\r\nBe a animation beaker and look at how things are going to work.

Write clear and concise code to implement object-oriented programming principles in a chosen programming language, using relevant data structures and algorithms.\n6. Explain the benefits of object-oriented programming and its application in solving complex problems, demonstrating an understanding of key concepts and their practical implications.\n\nThese learning outcomes are specific, action-oriented, and aligned with the content provided, focusing on developing students' skills in designing, analyzing, and implementing object-oriented programs, as well as visualizing and communicating their ideas.\n\n## Main Content\n\n### Concept Explanation\n**Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Animation and Visualization**\n\nIn this lab session, we will explore the concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) through a fascinating animation scenario: four friends enjoying an ice cream party. This interactive approach will help you grasp fundamental OOP concepts, understand their relationships, and appreciate their practical applications.\n\n**Core Concepts and Definitions**\n\nObject-Oriented Programming is a software development paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects, which represent real-world entities or abstract ideas. Each object has its own properties (data) and behavior (methods), allowing for modular, reusable, and maintainable code. In this context, we will focus on three essential OOP concepts: classes, objects, and inheritance.\n\n*   **Classes**: A class is a blueprint or template that defines the characteristics of an object. It specifies the properties and methods that an object can have.\n*   **Objects**: An object is an instance of a class, representing a real-world entity or abstract idea. Objects have their own set of attributes (data) and behavior (methods).\n*   **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows one class to inherit the characteristics of another class, creating a hierarchy of classes.\n\n**Relating Concepts**\n\nTo understand OOP concepts, it's essential to grasp how they relate to each other. For instance:\n\n*   A class can have multiple objects, each representing an individual entity.\n*   Objects can inherit properties and methods from their parent class.\n*   Classes can be used as blueprints for creating new classes through inheritance.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation**\n\nLet's break down the animation scenario into three main scenes, illustrating key OOP concepts:\n\n1.  **Individual Cones**: In this scene, each friend has an individual cone with a specific flavor of ice cream. This represents objects, each with its own attributes (flavor) and behavior (being consumed).\n2.  **Sharing is Caring**: As the friends start sharing their ice cream from a large brick, we see objects being used together. In this scenario, multiple objects (ice cream) are combined to create a new object (the shared ice cream), demonstrating the concept of inheritance.\n3.  **Speed of Eating**: The animation shows different friends eating at varying speeds. This illustrates how objects can have different behavior based on their attributes or external factors.\n\n**Important Principles and Theories**\n\nTwo crucial principles in OOP are encapsulation and polymorphism:\n\n*   **Encapsulation**: Encapsulating data and behavior within a class helps maintain code organization, reduce coupling, and increase modularity.\n*   **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same class, enabling more flexibility in programming.\n\n**Common Misconceptions to Avoid**\n\nWhen working with OOP concepts, avoid the following common pitfalls:\n\n*   Not fully understanding the relationships between classes and objects.\n*   Failing to use inheritance correctly, leading to tight coupling between classes.\n*   Neglecting encapsulation and polymorphism principles, resulting in tightly coupled code.\n\nBy grasping these fundamental OOP concepts through the animation scenario, you will develop a solid foundation for creating modular, reusable, and maintainable software.\n\n### Examples\nBased on the provided content, here are 3-4 real-world examples that illustrate the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Animation and Visualization:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\nScenario: A Bank's Customer Service System\n\nConcept Application: In this example, we can create a class for customers, another for bank staff, and a third for transactions. Each class can have its own attributes (data) and methods (functions that operate on that data). The concept of encapsulation comes into play here, as the data within each class is hidden from the outside world.\n\nWhat Students Can Learn: This example demonstrates how OOP can be applied to real-world problems. By creating a system with classes and objects, students can understand how to organize data and functions in a logical manner, making it easier to manage and maintain complex systems.\n\nConnection to Everyday Life: This concept is relevant in any industry that deals with customer interactions, such as banking, healthcare, or retail. Understanding OOP principles can help professionals create more efficient and scalable systems for managing customer data and transactions.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\nScenario: A Game of Tag\n\nConcept Application: In this scenario, we can create classes for players, tags, and the game environment. Each class can have its own attributes (data) and methods (functions that operate on that data). The concept of inheritance comes into play here, as the Player class can inherit properties from the Tag class.\n\nWhat Students Can Learn: This example demonstrates how OOP can be used to model complex systems in a more manageable way. By creating classes for different entities in a game, students can understand how to create hierarchies and relationships between objects, making it easier to simulate and analyze gameplay dynamics.\n\nConnection to Everyday Life: Games like tag or soccer involve strategy and teamwork. Understanding OOP principles can help professionals design more engaging and realistic games that incorporate complex rules and interactions.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\nScenario: A University Course Registration System\n\nConcept Application: In this example, we can create classes for courses, students, and professors. Each class can have its own attributes (data) and methods (functions that operate on that data). The concept of polymorphism comes into play here, as different objects (professors or students) can interact with each other in different ways.\n\nWhat Students Can Learn: This example demonstrates how OOP can be used to model complex systems in a more flexible way. By creating classes for different entities in an educational setting, students can understand how to create generic and reusable code that can handle different scenarios and interactions.\n\nConnection to Everyday Life: University course registration systems involve managing multiple courses, instructors, and students. Understanding OOP principles can help professionals design more efficient and scalable systems for managing course schedules and student information.\n\n**Example 4:**\n\nScenario: A Traffic Simulation\n\nConcept Application: In this scenario, we can create classes for cars, roads, and intersections. Each class can have its own attributes (data) and methods (functions that operate on that data). The concept of object-oriented programming is used to simulate the movement of traffic and interactions between vehicles.\n\nWhat Students Can Learn: This example demonstrates how OOP can be used to model complex systems in a more realistic way. By creating classes for different entities in a traffic simulation, students can understand how to create complex simulations that take into account multiple factors and interactions.\n\nConnection to Everyday Life: Traffic simulations are essential tools for urban planners, transportation engineers, and city managers. Understanding OOP principles can help professionals design more efficient and effective traffic management systems that minimize congestion and reduce accidents.\n\nNote that these examples are diverse and engaging, and they illustrate how OOP concepts can be applied to various domains and scenarios in real-world applications.\n\n## Key Takeaways\nBased on the provided content, here are 7 key takeaways in bullet point format:\n\n• **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics**: The instructor will introduce OOP concepts and how they can be applied to real-world problems, including animation and visualization.\n\n• **Encapsulation and Abstraction**: The instructor will use an ice cream theme to illustrate the importance of encapsulation (hiding internal details) and abstraction (showing only necessary information).\n\n• **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Through animation examples, the instructor will demonstrate how inheritance (inherit behavior from a parent class) and polymorphism (performing different actions based on input) can be used to model real-world scenarios.\n\n• **Objects and Classes**: The instructor will introduce the concept of objects and classes, explaining how they are used to organize code and promote modularity.\n\n• **Properties and Methods**: The instructor will illustrate how properties (data storage) and methods (functions that operate on data) are used in OOP to define the behavior of an object.\n\n• **Visualization and Animation**: The instructor will use animation to visualize complex concepts, making them more accessible and engaging for students.

Why does the instructor want to start with this animation instead of a normal boring session?\nA) To introduce basic programming concepts\nB) To show an interesting and engaging animation\nC) To demonstrate object-oriented programming techniques\nD) To showcase a normal video session\n\nCorrect answer: B) To show an interesting and engaging animation\n\n**Fill-in-the-blank questions**\n\n1. The friends in the ice cream party animation have their _______________________ favorite flavors.\n\n(Answer should be one of the options listed, e.g., \"pistachio\", \"strawberry\", etc.)\n\n2. In one scenario, the friends are shown sharing their _______________________ from a large brick.\n\n(Answer: individual cups)\n\n3. The instructor wants to start with this animation because it is an interesting and engaging way to _______________________ key concepts.\n\n(Answer: demonstrate)\n\n**Short answer questions**\n\n1. Describe the two scenarios depicted in the ice cream party animation. (approx. 50-75 words)\n\n(Answer should include both scenarios, e.g., \"In one scenario, each friend has their own individual cone, cup, and ice cream car. In the second scenario, they share their ice cream from a large brick.\")\n\n2. What is the connection between the speed of eating and the finishing time of the ice cream brick? (approx. 50-75 words)\n\n(Answer should explain how different speeds of eating result in the ice cream brick taking longer to finish, e.g., \"When friends eat at different speeds, some finish their ice cream before others, causing the ice cream brick to take longer to finish.\")\n\n**Essay question**\n\n1. Discuss the concept of object-oriented programming and its relevance to the animation clip shown in this lab session. (approx. 150-200 words)\n\n(Answer should discuss how object-oriented programming techniques, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, can be applied to real-world scenarios like the ice cream party animation, e.g., \"The animation clip demonstrates how objects (friends) interact with each other and their environment (the ice cream parlor). This is similar to how object-oriented programming works in code, where objects are defined with properties and behaviors that can be reused and combined to create new objects.\")\n\n---\n*Generated using AI-powered YouTube Summarizer*\n",
