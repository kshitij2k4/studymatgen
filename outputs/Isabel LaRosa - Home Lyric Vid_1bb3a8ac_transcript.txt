TRANSCRIPT:
Something could have to go on The house is empty, but I can't seem to let it go Somebody help me, show me how to be alone I'm almost twenty, but tell me why I feel so old Yeah, I can't move on, but there's nothing left to hold Don't think I'll ever go home I'm not a kid anymore I'm leaving a piece of my soul Don't think I'll ever go home And to my sister, call me when you need some help You know I'm with you, you're beautiful just as yourself To the boys that kiss her, you better fucking treat her well Cause I promised God for her I'd go to hell Don't think I'll ever go home I'm not a kid anymore I'm leaving a piece of my soul Don't think I'll ever go home I'm leaving a piece of my soul When you're my sister, call me when you need some help I'm leaving a piece of my soul I'm leaving a piece of your soul Don't think I'll ever go home I'm leaving a piece of my soul Don't think I'll ever go home Thank you.
