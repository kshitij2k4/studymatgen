1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
Something could have to go on

2
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:10,580
The house is empty, but I can't seem to let it go

3
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:16,539
Somebody help me, show me how to be alone

4
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,820
I'm almost twenty, but tell me why I feel so old

5
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:29,079
Yeah, I can't move on, but there's nothing left to hold

6
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,579
Don't think I'll ever go home

7
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,200
I'm not a kid anymore

8
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,359
I'm leaving a piece of my soul

9
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,140
Don't think I'll ever go home

10
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,219
And to my sister, call me when you need some help

11
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,200
You know I'm with you, you're beautiful just as yourself

12
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:11,379
To the boys that kiss her, you better fucking treat her well

13
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,680
Cause I promised God for her I'd go to hell

14
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,140
Don't think I'll ever go home

15
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,859
I'm not a kid anymore

16
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,200
I'm leaving a piece of my soul

17
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,159
Don't think I'll ever go home

18
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:42,819
I'm leaving a piece of my soul

19
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:42,819


20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,680
When you're my sister, call me when you need some help

21
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:48,859
I'm leaving a piece of my soul

22
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,879
I'm leaving a piece of your soul

23
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,439
Don't think I'll ever go home

24
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:56,920
I'm leaving a piece of my soul

25
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,080
Don't think I'll ever go home

26
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,900
Thank you.
